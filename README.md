less-template
=============

Personal less template, used for kickstarting new projects.

Contains snippets of reusable CSS, a collection of the ones I most often.

* Inspired by [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate)
* Uses [normalize.css](http://github.com/necolas/normalize.css)

## Why?

I have used the HTML5 Boilerplate since late 2010 with great pleasure. It teaches a lot of developers about the basics of web development.

So why did I create this template?
 
* A big part of the [H5BP](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/) **code is left in without having a purpose**, out of pure laziness of the cleanup afterwards. *Update:* This did change with version 4.0 and Initializr.com.
* Though heavily discussed in [Issue #857](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/issues/857) and advised against, the use of a CSS pre compiler is something I miss in development, and **speeds up my workflow** tremendously.
* _Opting for LESS.js over SASS;_ for a pure frontend developer that starts out with merely [a browser](http://google.com/chrome) and a [simple text editor](http://www.sublimetext.com) you **strive for zero dependencies**. Adding Ruby to the mix, over the purely client side parsing (in the development stage) feels like a step backwards.
* **Back to the basics**, with normalize.css, the core of the h5bp system. 

Somehow H5BP tends to make me lazy :)
